	<h2> about not_a_profile </h2>
	<p>a way to discover the city!  There are keys in the city (URLs) that someone left to be discovered  You can explore the city and discover new routes while looking for new keys  or let yourself be surprised by the keys you find on the road  You can find new people!  each key will give you access to a message that someone left in not_a_profile to be discovered. This message is unique, only who has the key can access it.  you can rate the message in a positive or negative way. whenever you rate it positively a link is established between you and the person who left it! compatibility will grow as more are common tastes.  You can also leave your own messages and wait until they are discovered... so what are you waiting for? :)
